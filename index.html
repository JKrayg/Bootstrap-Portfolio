                        <p id="indent">Hello! My name is Jake Krayger. I am a 23 year old student from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
                        A little bit about me, I grew up just outside of Northeast Philadelphia in a small neighborhood
                        called Rockledge with my Mother, my two brother's and our two jack russel's. I played sports for the local Philadlephia
                        rec center just inside of Northeast Philadelphia called Fox Chase. There I played soccer, baseball and basketball.
                        Around age 14 I left baseball and basketball behind but continued to play soccer for another 6 years into high school.</p>
                        <p id="indent">I graduated from Abington Sr High School in 2014 and
                        immediately started working because I was in no rush to be in debt from college. I worked at a financial
                        company called Finance of America as an assistant facilities manager (fancy for janitor). For as long as I can
                        remember I've been fascinated by computers, I remember when I was around 13 years old I would mod the Call of Duty titles
                        of that time on the xbox 360 (I thought I was so cool). Now I am a part of UPENN's coding bootcamp and I
                        couldn't be happier and excited for my future. I saved money and years of debt. I will also have a career
                        thatÂ is secure in the future because I dont think computers are going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
